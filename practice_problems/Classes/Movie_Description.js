// Movie Description extension - Classes Practice Problems
// Recall the Movie class you defined in one of the previous problems. Its description is given below for your reference.

// Previous description
// Write a Movie class for which you can create movie objects. The objects should have the following variables: lengthInMinutes, numCharacters, language. The class should have a run method which prints out: "This is a language movie with numCharacters characters and is lengthInMinutes minutes long."

// Now, we want to enhance the Movie class by adding a method to certify the movie.

// Current description
// Enhance the Movie class by adding a method certify, which returns true or false. It should return true if the movie has at least 2 characters and is less than or equal to 4 hours long (which means the movie is certified). Otherwise, it should return false. Modify the run message to include the certification.

// If certified then the message should be "This is a language movie with numCharacters characters, is lengthInMinutes minutes long and is certified."
// If not certified then the message should be "This is a language movie with numCharacters characters, is lengthInMinutes minutes long and is not certified."
// Input format
// First line is a string, denoting the language of the movie Second line is an integer, denoting the number of characters Third line is an integer, denoting the length in minutes

// Output format
// If certified then the output should be "This is a language movie with numCharacters characters, is lengthInMinutes minutes long and is certified."
// If not certified then the output should be "This is a language movie with numCharacters characters, is lengthInMinutes minutes long and is not certified." You need not worry about input/output. It is handled by the template provided. You only need to implement the Movie class.
// TestCase 1
// Input
// French
// 0
// 200
// Output
// This is a French movie with 0 characters, is 200 minutes long, and is not certified.

// TestCase 2
// Input

// 400
// Output
// This is a Hindi movie with 5 characters, is 400 minutes long, and is not certified.
