// area and perimeter of rectangle - Classes practice problems - JS
// Design a class which has 2 methods. One which computes the Area of the Rectangle. The other computes the Perimeter of the Rectangle. You should be able to pass the length length and width width while creating the object for the class. For all infeasible values of length length and width width, print area and perimeter as 0

// Your class should be named as Rectangle. Method to get area should be named as rectangleArea. Method to get perimeter should be named as rectanglePerimeter.

// Input
// First line contains an integer for the length l Second line contains an integer for the width w

// Output
// Two lines containing integers. First line containing the Area of the Rectangle Second line containing the Perimeter of the Rectangle

// Example
// Input:

// 3
// 2
// Output:

// 6
// 10
// Explanation

// First line is 3 representing the length. Second line is 2 representing the width. Area is 3*2 which is 6 as represented in the first line of the output. Perimeter is 2*(3 + 2) which is 10 as represented in the second line of the output.
