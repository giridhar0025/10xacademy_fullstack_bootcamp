// Addition
// Design a class Addition. This class should have three properties operandOne, operandTwo and result. There should be a method performSum() which will add the two operands and store it in the result and getSum() which will return the result. By default assume these two operands are integers.

// Next, design three subclasses addFloat, addArray, addString which will inherit all the functionalities of the Addition class. All these subclasses should contain their own performSum() methods. This is also known as method overriding.

// To add floats we simply add the two operands and return the final value. To add two arrays we add each element of the same index in both the arrays and return the final array. To add Strings we concatenate the two strings given and return the final string.

// Input
// You don't need to worry about input. Just complete the given class description.

// Output
// You don't need to output anything. It is already been done in driver code.

// Example
// Input1:

// 3

// 1 3 4 6 8 2

// 2 5 7 8 5 2

// Output1:

// 3

// 8

// 11

// 14

// 13

// 4

// Input2:

// 4

// ABCDE

// XYZFG

// Output2:

// ABCDEXYZFG
